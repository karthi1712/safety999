# 📘 **Project Details**

## 1. **Introduction**

The *Neighborhood Watch & Incident Reporting Platform* is a full-stack web application developed to enhance safety and communication within a community. The system enables residents to report incidents, view real-time updates, and collaborate with others in their locality. By leveraging modern web technologies, the platform provides a centralized and efficient mechanism for incident management and awareness.

---

## 2. **Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are:

* To provide a centralized platform for reporting and tracking incidents
* To enable real-time communication among community members
* To improve awareness of local safety issues
* To assist authorities with structured incident data
* To promote proactive community engagement

---

## 3. **System Architecture**

The system follows a **client-server architecture**:

### 🔹 Frontend (Client Side)

* Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Handles user interaction and UI rendering
* Communicates with backend using REST APIs

### 🔹 Backend (Server Side)

* Developed using Node.js and Express.js
* Handles API requests, authentication, and business logic

### 🔹 Database

* MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
* Stores user data, incidents, alerts, and logs

### 🔹 Data Flow

1. User submits data from frontend
2. API request sent to backend
3. Backend processes request
4. Data stored/retrieved from MongoDB
5. Response sent back to frontend
